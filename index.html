        <p>
            Hi there! I am an incoming <strong>Schwarzman Scholar</strong>, studying for a Masters in Global Affairs at Tsinghua University.
            I graduated from Harvard College in May 2024, Phi Beta Kappa with highest honors in Applied Mathematics in Economics and Computer Science, and East Asian Studies.
            I grew up in France, the United States, and Germany. I attended the French International High School in Berlin, graduating in 2020 with the highest grade point average in the French Baccaulaur√©at and the German Abitur. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I am currently really interested in the intersection of economics and artificial intelligence. I co-developed the <strong>Generalized Attribute Based Ratings Information Extraction Library (GABRIEL)</strong>, a Python library for feature extraction and quantification from text using large language models.  
            I used GABRIEL as part of my senior thesis at Harvard, advised by Prof. Andrei Shleifer, to study a database of over 150,000 full-text sermons given throughout the United States over a twenty year period. The thesis showed how sermons respond to demand from the congregation. 
            While an undergraduate, I worked with Prof. David Yang on Chinese investment in Africa, Prof. Myrto Kalouptsidi on maritime trade disruptions during Covid, and Prof. Michael Szonyi on land acquisition in pre-modern China.  
        </p>
        <p>I love learning languages and traveling. In the past, my work has taken me to Morocco - where I used machine learning to understand food security in Africa at the <strong>Policy Center for the New South</strong> - Argentina - where I presented my work on AI at the South American Business Forum - and Brazil (virtually), where I was a United States Department of State <strong>Critical Language Scholar</strong>. 
            I also worked with the Macro team at the <strong>DE Shaw Group</strong> in New York City, focusing on developing uses of large language models for macroeconomic analysis. 
        </p>
        <p>
            While at Harvard, I co-founded the <strong>Emerging Technology Group</strong>, Harvard's leading student organization focused on the impact of frontier technologies on society. 
            I also served as Co-President of the <strong>Charles River Economics Labs </strong> (CREL), a student club that has partnered with the State Department, UNDP, EPA, and other organizations to conduct pro-bono economics research. I was also an avid debater at the <strong>Harvard College Debating Union</strong>. 
            I was an undergraduate prize fellow at the <strong>Center for History and Economics</strong> and the two-time first place winner of the <strong>University of Chicago Econometrics Game</strong>.
