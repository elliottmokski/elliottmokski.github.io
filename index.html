            Hi there! I am a senior at Harvard College double concentrating in Applied Mathematics in Economics and Computer Science, and East Asian Studies. 
            I grew up in France, the United States, and Germany. I am currently really interested in the intersection of economics and artificial intelligence. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I co-developed the Generalized Attribute Based Ratings Information Extraction Library (GABRIEL), a Python framework for feature extraction and quantification from text using large language models.  
            I am using the framework as part of my senior thesis, advised by Prof. Andrei Shleifer, to understand sermons and religion speech in the United States respond to shocks like the financial crisis and Covid. 
            I have worked with Prof. David Yang on Chinese investment in Africa and Prof. Myrto Kalouptsidi on the trade disruptions during Covid. 
        </p>
        <p>I love learning languages and traveling. In the past, my work has taken me to Morocco - where I worked used machine learning to understand food security in Africa at the Policy Center for the New South - Argentina - where I presented my work on AI at the South American Business Forum - and Brazil (virtually), where I was a United States Department of State Critical Language Scholar. 
            I also worked with the Macro team at the DE Shaw Group in New York City, focusing on developing uses of large language models for macroeconomic analysis. 
        </p>
        <p>I am an incoming Schwarzman Scholar, studying for a Masters in Global Affairs at Tsinghua University. </p>
