        <p>
            Hi there! I am a senior at Harvard College double concentrating in Applied Mathematics in Economics and Computer Science, and East Asian Studies. 
            I grew up in France, the United States, and Germany. I am currently really interested in the intersection of economics and artificial intelligence. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I co-developed the <strong>Generalized Attribute Based Ratings Information Extraction Library (GABRIEL)</strong>, a Python library and API for feature extraction and quantification from text using large language models.  
            I am using the framework as part of my senior thesis, advised by Prof. Andrei Shleifer, to understand how sermons and religious speech in the United States respond to shocks like the financial crisis and Covid. 
            I have worked with Prof. David Yang on Chinese investment in Africa, Prof. Myrto Kalouptsidi on maritime trade disruptions during Covid, and Prof. Michael Szonyi on land acquisition in pre-modern China.  
        </p>
        <p>I love learning languages and traveling. In the past, my work has taken me to Morocco - where I worked used machine learning to understand food security in Africa at the Policy Center for the New South - Argentina - where I presented my work on AI at the South American Business Forum - and Brazil (virtually), where I was a United States Department of State Critical Language Scholar. 
            I also worked with the Macro team at the <strong>DE Shaw Group</strong> in New York City, focusing on developing uses of large language models for macroeconomic analysis. 
        </p>
        <p>I am an incoming <strong>Schwarzman Scholar</strong>, studying for a Masters in Global Affairs at Tsinghua University. </p>
        <p>
            At Harvard, I co-founded the <strong>Emerging Technology Group</strong>, Harvard's leading student organizing focused on the impact of frontier technologies on society. 
            I also served as Co-President of the <strong>Charles River Economics Labs </strong> (CREL), a student organization that has partnered with the State Department, UNDP, EPA, and other organizations to conduct pro-bono economics research. I am also an avid debater at the <strong>Harvard College Debating Union</strong>. 
            I was elected to <strong>Phi Beta Kappa</strong> as part of the Senior 48 cohort and am an undergraduate prize fellow at the <strong>Center for History and Economics</strong>.
